      ASOF
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
 Short for A Song of Praise Music Festival, ASOP is a songwriting event of the Church dedicated to songs of praise to God. MCGI Leaders launched the songwriting festival as a yearly event in 2004. ASOP turned bi-annual in 2009, giving way to the Mid-Year and Year-End Finals.

Though joining or even watching ASOP requires no fee, MCGI leaders have given more than millions of pesos in prizes just to hear the best songs of praise that can be crafted by the hearts and minds of men.

     International Theater Summit 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
 To add color to the stage during an event, MCGI's Teatro Kristiano group dances to the beat of heavenly tunes produced by the choir and the ADD Strings, the Church's orchestra.

Yearly, they gather at the Convention Center to showcase their dancing and acting skills. Teatro Kristiano groups from different Divisions do their best in interpreting a Church song, aiming to tell the story behind it as visually-pleasing as possible.

    National Locale Choir Music Summit 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
 While youths participate in the yearly Music and Theater Summits, it is the married couples in the Church who compose the participants of the National Locale Choir Music Summit.

Locale Choir representatives from different Church regions give their best in rendering new compositions based on a theme and songs from the hymn book. Locale Choirs are the groups that lead the congregational singing during Church services in the Locales.
