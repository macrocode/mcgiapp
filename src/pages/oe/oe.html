    Mass Indoctrination 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
   A simultaneous series of indoctrination sessions across the Philippines and abroad where Bro. Eli teaches the undefiled doctrines of the Lord Jesus Christ. Visitors gathered at MCGI Coordinating Centers learn a doctrine a day through a pre-recorded Mass Indoctrination. The indoctrination session is a required process before a person is permitted to receive baptism.

  Mass Baptism
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
 


For attendees of the Mass Indoctrination series who wish to be members of the Church of God International, this is where their indoctrination ends and their new life as Christians begin.

Candidates for baptism coming from Metro Manila and nearby provinces flock to the ADD Convention Center in Apalit, Pampanga to hear the doctrine for baptism and, should they decide, be baptized. Those from Visayas, Mindanao and outside the country go to other dedicated venues for the service.

 Couples International Convention 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
  An annual service where couples in the Church attend a mass wedding to hear God's doctrines on marriage, as well as consult their marital and spiritual problems with MCGI Leaders.

The mass wedding and all other Church rites are administered for free, according to the Lord's commandment in Matthew 10:8.

 Christian New Year 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
  MCGI follows the New Year of the Hebrew calendar, the first of Abib or Nisan, which falls around April. Unlike the usual New Year celebration, members conduct a Thanksgiving service where they offer songs and prayers to the Almighty Father for another year He has given.

The Lord's Supper 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
 The Church commemorates the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ to cleanse the sins of men every Nisan 13. Before sunset, which is the start of a biblical day, members gather to sing praises, pray, and study a topic related to the celebration. Though MCGI leaders prepare a common meal for the attendees, congregants know that the true food and drink for the evening are the spiritual bread and wine taught in the Bible.
