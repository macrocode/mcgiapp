     The ADD Convention Center<br /><br />
     
    Located at Apalit, Pampanga, the Ang Dating Daan Convention Center is the Philippine headquarters of MCGI.
    Home of major Church events like the quarterly International Thanksgiving (or the Pasalamat ng Katawan) where it accommodates tens of thousands of people. Regular Church services also take place here. Weekly, this is where believers get baptized and congregants give thanks to God.
    The ADD Convention Center is also the venue where Bible Expositions and other international events like the bi-annual A Song of Praise (ASOP) Music Festival are held. Occasionally, it hosts benefit concerts, Church conventions, and Ang Dating Daan (The Old Path) anniversaries.

   The Chapel<br /><br />

    The Chapel at the ADD Compound in Pampanga is a multi-purpose venue for Church services - from the 24/7 praise-singing and community prayer to Mass Indoctrination sessions.
    During International Thanksgivings, the Chapel also serves as an extension of the Convention in welcoming its countless attendees.
    <br /><br />
    The Locale and Coordinating Center<br /><br />

    The Locale in the communities outside of Apalit, Pampanga, is where brethren meet weekly to attend different Church services, as well as host Indoctrination sessions.
    Though some also have satellite dishes, it is the Coordinating Centers that are equipped for receiving satellite and Internet feeds for Worldwide Bible Expositions and special religious gatherings. Coordinating Centers are also ready to receive inquiries about schedules of Church services and Mass Indoctrinations in their area.
