    BIBLE EXPOSITION
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
   
Propagating truths in the Bible and exposing frauds in the religious world before live crowds, MCGI's Bible Exposition has accommodated countless people and entertained queries of faith and spirituality with the question-and-answer program of Bro. Eli since 1993. 

 Like all other Church services, the Bible Exposition is free. All are welcome to attend and ask Bro. Eli Soriano any question they may have of the Bible and its Author. And for their indulgence to MCGI's invitation, guests are even served food and drinks.

    Worldwide Bible Exposition

    Employing the World Wide Web and seven satellites circling the globe, MCGI's Worldwide Bible Exposition connects locations across six continents to query Bro. Eli Soriano. In the Philippines (GMT+8), the program starts at 6:30 in the evening until about midnight.
   
    Marathon Bible Exposition

    "East meets West" gets redefined once more with this Bible Exposition that lasts up to ten or twelve hours. The Marathon Bible Exposition aims to entertain questions coming from the East during night time, and those from the Western hemisphere during day time.
