     WORSHIP SERVICE AND PRAYER MEETINGS 
     </ion-card-title>
    <p>
     <strong> Worship Service</strong><br /><br />

As with any Church gathering, the Worship Service starts with congregational singing led by a choir. Observing St. Paul's admonition to first-century Christians in 1 Corinthians 14:26, this serves as a time to reflect and ready one's self for prayer.

Prayers are led by a Church minister or worker. While brethren kneel in prayer (Psalms 92:6; Acts 20:36; Matthew 26:39), guests are free to stay in their seats.<br />

After the prayer is a Bible-reading segment (Deuteronomy 17:19), where a chapter or two of the Bible is read. Attendees listen to a recorded audio of the verses that are being read as the verses are displayed on television screens. Added to the previous service obtaining in 2011, MCGI started with the Book of Genesis to initiate bible-reading sessions.<br />

Members then listen to a topic prepared and delivered by Bro. Eli Soriano and Bro. Daniel Razon respectively. The topic is delivered in portions and is continued in the following Prayer Meeting.<br />

The worship service is also the time when members give their financial contribution to the Church as written in 1 Corinthians 16:1-2.<br /><br />

<strong>Prayer Meeting</strong><br /><br />

As the name implies, Prayer Meeting was originally a time for members to meet midweek to pray. The time came however when brethren requested that they hear a biblical topic as well. Since then, the Prayer Meeting became similar in format to the Worship Service, albeit, without the monetary contribution. This service is based on Hebrews 10:25-26.<br />

The Prayer Meeting is done on Wednesdays and Thursdays at different schedules in the morning, afternoon, and evening.<br /><br />

<strong>Special Prayer Meeting</strong><br /><br />

Monthly, MCGI leaders deliver the topic for the Prayer Meeting live and in full. It also serves as an additional venue where they can discuss some Church matters with the brethren. The event is scheduled every first Tuesday of the month. The first service begins at sunset. <br />
